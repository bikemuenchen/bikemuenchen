Hey there, cycling enthusiasts! 👋

I'm the creator behind Bike München, sharing practical cycling knowledge from Munich to the world. What started in 2025 in a small garage has grown into a community of thousands who believe every ride should be more enjoyable.

**What I Do:**
- Share real-world cycling tips that actually work
- Create repair and maintenance tutorials you can follow along
- Provide bike restoration content and techniques  
- Offer practical hacks for commuting, training, and exploring

**My Philosophy:**
Clear, honest, tested advice — whether you're just starting your cycling journey or you've been riding for years. No fluff, just knowledge that helps you get the most out of your two wheels.

When I'm not creating content, you'll find me in the workshop testing new techniques or out on the streets of Munich discovering what really works in everyday cycling.

Join our growing community for tips, hacks, and how-tos that make every ride better! 

From Munich with ❤️ for all things cycling
